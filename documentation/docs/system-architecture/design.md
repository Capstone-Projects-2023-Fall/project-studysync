## Server
StudySync is an easy-to-use learning platform where users can study, interact with friends, and manage their profiles. Itâ€™s powered by Firebase from Google Cloud, ensuring everything runs smoothly and securely. Users can quickly access up-to-date study materials like flashcards and quizzes, and the platform can respond in real-time to keep users engaged. 

The server part of StudySync uses Firebase, and it acts like the spine of the platform, making sure everything talks to each other safely and quickly. we mainly look after sign-ins and managing data. When someone logs in, Firebase makes sure the login details are correct and keeps the user's session safe while they use the platform.From the user-friendly dashboard on the user's side, users can ask to see or change data, and the Firebase Database on the server side takes care of these requests. This lets users see and interact with their study materials and profiles instantly and consistently.The way Firebase services blend with the user side means users get a smooth, safe, and quick experience. They get a central place for learning tools and interactions, and they receive personalized notifications without hassle. This collaboration between the server and user side lets StudySync give a fun learning experience, focusing on easy interactions and safe access to learning materials.



## Database
#### Database Model

StudySync will be using a Firebase NoSQL database to store all data. The database will be made up of the following collections: 
- **User**: This collection stores everything related to a single user. 
- **Notifications**: Stores all the metadata related to a notification
- **Event**: Store metadata for each event
- **FlashCard**: Representation of an entire stack of flashcards. Made up of flashcard items
- **FlashCardItem**: A single flash card
- **Quiz**: A quiz object generated based on a flash card.
- **EventType**: This is a static list of different types of events. 

For single properties on a user model such as email, password and name, we will just store it in the user the corresponding collection. For more complex properties such as notifications, followers and following, flashcards and events, we will store the ids of each corresponding field in the user collection and query the respective collection as needed. To be more specific, in the case of notifications, the actual data for notifications will be stored in the Notifications collections, anytime we need to query user notifications, we can do this easily by fetching all the notification ids for that user from the Users collection and then querying the Notifications collection using those ids. This same idea applies to fetching events for Notifications
