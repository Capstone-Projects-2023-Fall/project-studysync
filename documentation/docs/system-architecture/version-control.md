# Version Control


For our project, we're using GitHub to keep track of our code. We've made sure that no one can change the main branch unless two of us agree on a pull request. If someone's just updating our docs, they can put it straight into the main branch. We're doing separate branches for each new thing we're working on. Also, we'll save a version of our work on GitHub right before we show it off at each big project check-in.
