# System Overview

## Project Proposal

### Title 
StudySync - A Comprehensive Web-based Study Tool. To design an interactive, web-based studying platform where users can customize flashcards for effective learning, add friends, and challenge each other with quizzes.

### Key Features:
1. **Flashcard Creation & Customization:** Users can add terms and definitions to flashcards. These cards can be further customized based on priority, difficulty, and upcoming study dates.
2. **Interactivity & Collaboration:** Users can upvote/downvote cards, add comments, and organize their study materials.
3. **Social Learning:** The platform allows users to add friends, create quizzes/tests for each other, and even compete based on test scores.
4. **User Account Management:** Secure login capabilities with personal data stored in a MongoDB database.


## Conceptual Design

### Architecture:
The application is designed as a full-stack web application.

1. **Frontend:** Developed using ReactJs, offering an interactive interface for users.
2. **Backend:** Built using NodeJs and ExpressJs, responsible for server operations and API functionalities.
3. **Database:** MongoDB is chosen as the database system to store user information, flashcards, comments, and quiz scores.
4. **Integration:** The backend will serve the frontend through API endpoints, with data interchange in JSON format.

## Background

The idea of StudySync is derived from platforms like Quizlet, which assist students in using cards to learn new terms and definitions.Unlike traditional study tools, StudySync introduces a gamified and collaborative approach to learning. The system offers a plethora of customization options, including the ability to upvote/downvote flashcards and organize them based on various parameters. Additionally, the social aspect of adding friends and creating shared learning experiences stands out.
