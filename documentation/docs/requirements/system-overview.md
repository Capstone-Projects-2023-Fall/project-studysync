# System Overview

## Project Proposal

### 
StudySync is an innovative online learning platform designed to offer an interactive and customized study experience. With the integration of AI, the platform now allows users to generate flashcards and quizzes automatically, using uploaded images and text. This AI-enhanced feature significantly streamlines the learning process, making it more efficient and tailored to individual needs. Users can still create, customize, and share flashcards, but with added AI capabilities, they can easily convert their study materials into interactive learning tools. The platform also maintains its social aspects by enabling users to connect with peers, share resources, and engage in collaborative learning.

The evolution of StudySync addresses the growing need for educational tools that are both informative and user-friendly. By automating the creation of study materials, the platform caters to a wide spectrum of learning preferences and needs, adapting to various learning styles and paces. The social and collaborative aspects of the platform, such as adding friends and participating in shared quizzes, foster a community of learners who support and challenge each other.


### Key Features:
1. **AI-Generated Flashcards & Quizzes:** Users can upload images or text, and the AI will generate relevant flashcards and quizzes.
2. **Flashcard & quiz Customization:** Manual creation and customization of flashcards and quizzes based on priority, difficulty, and study schedules.
3. **Social Learning:** Features include adding friends, sharing resources and a leaderboard to track quiz scores.
4. **Interactivit:** Users can upvote/downvote cards, comment, and organize their study materials.
5. **User Account Management:** Secure login with personal data storage in a Firebase database.


## Conceptual Design

### Architecture:
The application is designed as a full-stack web application.

1. **Frontend:** Developed using ReactJs, offering an interactive interface for users.
2. **Backend:** Leveraging Firebase for server operations, database management, and user authentication.
3. **Database:** Firebase database is chosen as the database system to store user information, flashcards, comments, and quiz scores.
4. **Social and Gamification Features:** Incorporating social elements like friend connections, resource sharing, and a leaderboard system for quiz scores.
5. **AI Integration:** ChatGPT integrated via Firebase Cloud Functions to analyze inputs and generate educational content.

## Background

Drawing inspiration from platforms such as Quizlet, StudySync transcends traditional study tools by harnessing the power of AI and social features. The addition of a leaderboard introduces a competitive edge, motivating users to engage more deeply with the content. The use of ChatGPT for content generation and Firebase for backend operations positions StudySync at the forefront of digital learning solutions, offering a unique, adaptive, and user-friendly educational experience.
