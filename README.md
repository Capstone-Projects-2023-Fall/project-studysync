## Project Abstract

### Title 
StudySync - A Comprehensive Web-based Study Tool. To design an interactive, web-based studying platform where users can customize flashcards for effective learning, add friends, and challenge each other with quizzes.

### Key Features:
1. **Flashcard Creation & Customization:** Users can add terms and definitions to flashcards. These cards can be further customized based on priority, difficulty, and upcoming study dates.
2. **Interactivity & Collaboration:** Users can upvote/downvote cards, add comments, and organize their study materials.
3. **Social Learning:** The platform allows users to add friends, create quizzes/tests for each other, and even compete based on test scores.
4. **User Account Management:** Secure login capabilities with personal data stored in a MongoDB database.

## High Level Requirement

StudySync is a comprehensive, user-centric digital study tool designed for enhanced interactive learning. Users can craft, customize, and categorize flashcards for efficient knowledge retention, bolstered by features like prioritization, comments, and upvote/downvote mechanisms. Moreover, it fosters a collaborative learning ecosystem where users can connect with peers, exchange study materials, challenge each other through quizzes, and track their collaborative progress. Embedded with a user-friendly interface powered by ReactJs and backed by a robust MongoDB database, StudySync offers a secure, seamless experience, marrying the best of individualized study and social learning.

## Conceptual Design

### Architecture:
The application is designed as a full-stack web application.

1. **Frontend:** Developed using ReactJs, offering an interactive interface for users.
2. **Backend:** Built using NodeJs and ExpressJs, responsible for server operations and API functionalities.
3. **Database:** MongoDB is chosen as the database system to store user information, flashcards, comments, and quiz scores.
4. **Integration:** The backend will serve the frontend through API endpoints, with data interchange in JSON format.

## Background

The idea of StudySync is derived from platforms like Quizlet, which assist students in using cards to learn new terms and definitions.Unlike traditional study tools, StudySync introduces a gamified and collaborative approach to learning. The system offers a plethora of customization options, including the ability to upvote/downvote flashcards and organize them based on various parameters. Additionally, the social aspect of adding friends and creating shared learning experiences stands out.

## Required Resources

To successfully develop StudySync, we'll need a thorough understanding of ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. Hardware-wise, potent development computers and a robust server (either on-premise or cloud-based) are crucial. On the software front, essential tools include development frameworks for React, Node, and MongoDB, an IDE like Visual Studio Code, version control via GitHub, and testing tools like Jest and Postman.
